# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis in Telecommunications

In this case study, I analyzed a dataset from a telecommunications company to identify and reduce customer churn. I explored the causes of churn by creating calculated columns, PivotTables, and a visual dashboard.

The project was conducted in Excel, and the file can be found in the repository named 'Case Study.xlsx'.

## 📈 Case Study Conclusion
- We found that Databel serves over 6,500 clients with a churn rate of 26.86%.
- The main reason for churn is competition offering better devices and deals, not necessarily better service.
- Clients over 65 have a churn rate close to 40%, although they make up a smaller portion of our client base.
- Clients aged 19-28 have the lowest churn rate and are crucial due to their loyalty and lasting consumption habits.
- We also observed that clients using less than 5 GB of data are most likely to churn (nearly 35%).
- Additionally, one state has an unusually high churn rate of 75% for clients with international plans.
- This is critical information for reallocating the budget for targeted promotions in this state. Conversely, only four states had a lower churn rate of 25%.

## 💡 Suggested Solutions
- Implement exclusive promotions for clients with international plans.
- Develop more attractive plans for clients with low data usage.
- Create loyalty programs for senior clients.
- Investigate competitors' offers and adjust strategies to match or exceed them.
