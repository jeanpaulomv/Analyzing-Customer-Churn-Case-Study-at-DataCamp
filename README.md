# Customer Churn Analysis in Telecommunications

## Overview
In this case study, I analyzed a dataset from a telecommunications company to identify and mitigate customer churn. The analysis involved creating calculated columns, PivotTables, and a comprehensive visual dashboard to understand the factors driving customer churn and to formulate strategies to address them.

The project was conducted in Excel, and the complete analysis is available in the repository under the file name 'Case Study.xlsx'.

## Objectives
- **Identify** the key factors driving customer churn.
- **Analyze** customer segments and their churn rates.
- **Develop** actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn.

## Data Description
The dataset includes various features related to customer demographics, usage patterns, and service plans. Key variables analyzed include:
- **Customer Age**
- **Data Usage**
- **Service Plan**
- **Churn Rate**
- **International Plans**

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted initial analysis to uncover patterns and anomalies.
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Used calculated columns and PivotTables to explore relationships and trends.
4. **Visualization**: Developed a visual dashboard to effectively present findings.

## Key Findings
- **Overall Churn Rate**: Databel serves over 6,500 clients with a churn rate of 26.86%.
- **Major Churn Drivers**: Competition offering better devices and deals is the primary reason for churn.
- **Age Factor**: Clients over 65 have a churn rate close to 40%. Conversely, clients aged 19-28 have the lowest churn rate.
- **Data Usage**: Clients using less than 5 GB of data are most likely to churn (nearly 35%).
- **Geographical Insights**: One state shows an unusually high churn rate of 75% for clients with international plans.

## Recommendations
- **Promotions**: Implement exclusive offers for clients with international plans.
- **Plan Development**: Create more attractive plans for clients with low data usage.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Develop targeted loyalty programs for senior clients.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Investigate competitors' offers and adjust strategies to match or exceed them.

## Skills Utilized
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data preparation, PivotTables, and advanced calculations.
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of dashboards and visual reports.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical analysis and trend identification.
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth examination of data patterns and insights.
